===Introduction===
Wikidata is a secondary database that collects structured data to provide support for the wikimedia movement and as part of this function, provides a system of identifying authors of scientific articles that makes it easy to access more information about the authors. Authors of scientific articles are grouped in two major ways: {{P|P50}}, when there exists a wikidata entry for the individual or {{P|P2093}}, when the individual is unknown or there is no wikidata entry for the individual. Articles whose authors are grouped under {{P|P50}} have some properties and values under those properties that reveal more details about the individuals. In these series of selected scientific articles are the different ways we describe how authors are recorded, how the author names are ordered, and how additional information is stored under {{P|P50}} like {{P|P31}}, {{P|P21}}, {{P|P735}}, and '''Identifiers''', which is a type of property that links an item to an external database, such as an authority control database used by libraries and archives, etc.<br>


'''A.''' The following articles are about '''Directed Evolution''', a method used in protein engineering that mimics the process of natural selection to steer proteins or nucleic acids toward a user-defined goal.

#**I added the {{P|P734}}, "Wong" as part of the author details but I couldn't add the {{P|P735}}, "Kwok-Yin" as it was not appearing in the list of options to select.

===Conclusion===
'''Properties''', usually preceded by a P, are descriptive characteristics that explain a statement. They sometimes have '''Values,''' preceded by a Q, which also contains additional data that better explains a statement. For example, {{P|P21}} is a Property and {{Q|Q6581072}} is a Value that explains the property further. Both properties and values are tools which give detailed characteristics of Items on wikidata.

Working on this task has given me better appreciation for the way data is gathered and stored across all the wikimedia platforms. I look forward to contributing more on this project.
